# Movie Recommendation System - ALX Kaggle Challenge

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for the ALX Kaggle movie recommendation challenge. Using the SVD++ algorithm from the Surprise library, I analyzed a dataset of 10M ratings, performed exploratory data analysis, and built a model that achieved an RMSE of 0.8 on the test set.

## Key Highlights
- Dataset: 10M ratings, 162,541 users, 48,213 movies (train); 5M rows, 5,044 new movies (test).
- Approach: Collaborative filtering with SVD++.
- Result: RMSE of 0.8 on Kaggle test set.

## How to Use
Open `movie-recommendation-svdpp-alx-kaggle.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or view it directly on GitHub.
